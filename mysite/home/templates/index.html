        <h2>How can we improve the browser experience</h2>
        <p>Conventional monetization of webpages is performed through advertisement. As the internet has grown, so has the
        presence of advertisement. This growth of advertisement as a monetization method has caused webpages to be cramped with adverts which can often irritate
        or inhibit the Users viewing experience. A solution proposed to rival advertisement is Cryptocurrency mining in the browser.
        <br><br>
        Cryptocurrency, in simple terms, is a form of digital currency that is secured by cryptography. Cryptocurrency's are based on the principle of blockchain technology - A
        distributed ledger enforced by nodes (A fancy word for a computer that verifies and stores all of the blockchains previous activity). This allows Cryptocurrencys to operate on a
        decentralised basis, without the intrusion of any Governments or banks.
        <br><br>

        This website is an experimental platform to test cryptocurrency mining in the browser as an alternative to advertisement. While browsing on this website your device will be mining
        cryptocurrency in exchange for an ad-free experience. You may notice performance drops from your device so please report this to the survey if you do notice any.
